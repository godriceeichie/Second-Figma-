                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                    were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                    honestly feel I got every penny's worth;

                        I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking 
                        to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
                        here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
                        enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling
                        - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've succesfully switched careers,
                        working as a Software Engineer at a VR Startup.

                        Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
